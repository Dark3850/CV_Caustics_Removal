## üß≠ Overview

Traditional methods for shallow water (<5‚ÄØm) mapping are expensive and spatially constrained due to the complexity of sensor deployment in remote coastal zones. These limitations hinder wide-scale monitoring of ecologically critical near-shore benthic habitats.

This project leverages **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)** to collect high-resolution video data and introduces a novel processing pipeline to remove **optical distortions** such as:
- üí° Light **refraction**
- üåä **Caustics**
- ‚ú® **Sun glint**

---

## üîç Methodology

In our study, we process Full-HD 60 FPS UAV videos captured at altitudes ranging from **10‚ÄØm to 120‚ÄØm**. Our approach includes:

- üéûÔ∏è **Frame Extraction**
- üßÆ **Image Averaging (Median Filtering)**
- üé® **Color Transferring Correction**

## üìä Key Results

In the final enhancement, we were able to achieve not only the restoration of the geometries, but also a color enhancement to better discriminate the underwater scenary.

## üöÄ Usage

### üîß Installation

Clone the repository and install required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dark3850/CV_Caustics_Removal.git
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

The Python version used in our work is `python==3.9.1`

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Pipeline

1. To download the sample video, use this [Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fm17AQia0bVttX4vSvrwrepVpf3g033v?usp=sharing).  
2. Place the video file in the `Caustics_Removal` folder.  
3. Then simply run the `CV_Caustics_Removal.jpynb` notebook.

On a general note, you will find the ground truth image to perform the final enhancement correction in the `Caustics_Removal/5_Target` folder. This image was the one 
used in our study.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Pipeline on your data

1. Be sure to put all your UAV videos in the `Caustics_Removal` folder.
2. Put your ground truth image in the `Caustics_Removal/5_Target` fodler. For more details on the GT iamge selection, look at our paper.
3. Run the `CV_Caustics_Removal.jpynb` notebook. The folder structure is already given in the repository.
